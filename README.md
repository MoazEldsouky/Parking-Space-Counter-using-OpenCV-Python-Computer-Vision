# Parking Space Counter Using OpenCV and Python

This project demonstrates a parking space counter using OpenCV and Python. The system detects and counts available parking spaces in a video feed using computer vision techniques.

## Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to develop a computer vision application that counts the number of available parking spaces in a video. The system processes video frames, analyzes the parking spaces, and displays the count of free and occupied spots.

## Files

- `Parking_space_posintions.py`: Script for defining and managing parking space positions.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.
- `carPark.mp4`: Input video file used for parking space detection.
- `example_image.png`: Example image used for visualization or testing.
- `main.py`: Main script for running the parking space counter application.
- `output.mp4`: Output video showing the parking space count annotations.
- `positions`: Binary file containing parking space positions.
- `requirements.txt`: File listing the Python dependencies required for the project.
