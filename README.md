This project implements a parking space counter using OpenCV and Python.

**Files:**

* `Parking_space_posintions.py`: Defines functions to identify parking space positions in an image.
* `carPark.mp4`: (Optional) Sample video footage of a parking lot.
* `example_image.png`: (Optional) Sample image of a parking lot.
* `main.py`: The main script that integrates all components and performs the parking space counting.
* `output.mp4`: (Optional) Output video showing the identified parking spaces (if applicable).
* `positions.py`: (Optional) Script for managing parking space positions.

**Quick Start Demo**

A basic demo showcasing the parking space counter functionality can be implemented using `main.py`. However, including a video demo (e.g., `output.mp4`) in this repository would be beneficial for users.

**Installation**

(Prerequisites: Python with OpenCV library)

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone [invalid URL removed]
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd parking-space-counter
```

3. Install required dependencies:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
# Install other dependencies if needed
```

**Usage**

1. Run the main script:

```bash
python main.py
```

(Replace `main.py` with the appropriate script name if using a different entry point)

2. The script will process the specified video or image (modify `main.py` for input selection) and potentially generate an output video showcasing the identified parking spaces.
