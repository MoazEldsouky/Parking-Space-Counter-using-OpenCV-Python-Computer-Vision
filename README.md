# Parking Space Counter Using OpenCV and Python

This project demonstrates a parking space counter using OpenCV and Python. The system detects and counts available parking spaces in a video feed using computer vision techniques.

## Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to develop a computer vision application that counts the number of available parking spaces in a video. The system processes video frames, analyzes the parking spaces, and displays the count of free and occupied spots.

## Files

- `Parking_space_posintions.py`: Script for defining and managing parking space positions.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.
- `carPark.mp4`: Input video file used for parking space detection.
- `example_image.png`: Example image used for visualization or testing.
- `main.py`: Main script for running the parking space counter application.
- `output.mp4`: Output video showing the parking space count annotations.
- `positions`: Binary file containing parking space positions.
- `requirements.txt`: File listing the Python dependencies required for the project.

## Setup and Installation

To set up the project and install the necessary dependencies, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Parking-Space-Counter-using-OpenCV-Python-Computer-Vision.git
   cd Parking-Space-Counter-using-OpenCV-Python-Computer-Vision
   ```

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**

   ```sh
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Application**

   To start the parking space counter, execute the following command:

   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

## Output

The processed video with parking space count annotations is saved as `output.mp4`. Here is a preview of the output video:

![Output Video](output.mp4)

## Dependencies

The `requirements.txt` file includes the necessary Python libraries for this project. Ensure you have the following packages installed:

- `opencv-python`
- `cvzone`
- `numpy`

## Usage

1. **Adjust Parking Space Positions**: Modify `Parking_space_posintions.py` to set the positions of parking spaces in the video.
2. **Process the Video**: The `main.py` script processes the video `carPark.mp4`, counts the available parking spaces, and saves the output to `output.mp4`.
